Brainstorming:

Keeping a fire going. On a deserted island for a smoke signal. In a frozen tundra to stay warm. In a dark cave to stave off monsters and to be able to see. I like the cave one.


Premise:
* You drop down into a cave. You have a torch that is burning out. Maybe it has roots or plants. That can be used as fuel. Moss? Oil?
* Your task is to keep the fire going to ward off bats, monsters, etc.
* You can hold the torch. You can light things up. This provides visiblity but also repels creepies.
* What's the end condition?
    * Last as long as possible?
    * Escape the cave? I like escape the cave but it might be difficult.
* Other hazards:
    * Water - puts out flames.
    * Bats - fly at you but get repeled by light?
    * No clue?

Is this a platformer? Top down? Might be good as top down. Keeps the game simpler.

So what are the things on the field?

* You. Has a torch. Can swing torch to light things up. Scare off baddies.
* Roots, moss, oil? Maybe this is an underground ruined temple. So there are more interesting things.
    * Treasure.
    * Braziers.
    * 



Premise:
* You are an explorer. You dive down into some cursed underground ruins in search of treasure. You need to get as much treasure as you can and return to the surface.
* It is dark, but you have a flickering torch to help you see. You are running out of fuel to burn however.
* The ruins are cursed. Monsters are out to get you, but they are scared of light.

Gameplay:
* Top Down.
* You can swing your torch, the aeration makes it burn brigher but also depletes your fuel faster.
* Swinging is used to burn things and to spook away monsters.
* Things to burn:
    * Moss.
    * Braziers.
    * Roots.
    * Logs.
    * (All the same thing mechanically.)
* You can find chests which can have:
    * Treasure.
    * Kindling.
* Chests take time to open. It's a good idea to keep fire around while you open them.
* Treasure is the main objective, but you need to make it back to score and win.
* Kindling can be used for two things:
    * Drop onto the floor, light with torch.
    * "Refuel" your torch. Yeah I know, who cares, it's a video game.


So far, these are the key pieces:

* ~~Dynamic Lighting. Never done it. This might suck.~~
* Player.
    * ~~Move. (ARROW KEYS)~~
    * ~~Swing. (Z)~~
    * ~~Open chests. (X)~~
    * Pick/Drop kindling. (X)
        * The X button is contextual. If near chest, open. If near kindling, pick up. Otherwise, drop kindling.
* Enemies.
    * Bat. Flies straight at you. Close contact with fire makes it flee.
    * Giant Spider. Crawls slower. If it runs through fire it will flee. Only flees when burning.
    * Ghost. Slow, hard to spot unless there is light. Requires swinging to make it go away.
* Chest.
    * Takes time to unlock.
    * Gives kindling or treasure.
    * Possible variants: Better chests take longer to open but give more kindling or treasure.
* Braziers/Moss/Roots
    * Swing to light for some time.
* (Stretch Goal) Turn manually created level into randomly-generated.
* (Stretch Goal) Water Puddles
    * Extingishes fire faster.
* (Stretch Goal) Fire spread?
* Balancing.
    * The longer the game last the rarer kindling is.
* Entrance/Exit
    * Reach it to end the game.

Other Stuff:
* Leaderboard.
* UI.

* Sounds.
* Lighting.
* Pixel Art.
* Particles. (Embers, Smoke)
* Glowing fire shader.
* Screen shaking.
* Time deltas.
